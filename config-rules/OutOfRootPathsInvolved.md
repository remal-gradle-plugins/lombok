# `OutOfRootPathsInvolved`

`lombok.config` files outside of the root project or the repository root are involved into the build. This makes the build system dependent, as some developers can have their own `lombok.config` files.

See [https://projectlombok.org/features/configuration](https://projectlombok.org/features/configuration).
